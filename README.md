PyCity Schools

This code is built to analyze two CSV files, schools_complete and students_complete to better understand the relationship between
a variety of variables and test scores

The code starts by importing dependencies, reading the CSV files into Pandas DataFrames, and taking some general data to create a District Key Points Summary

Then we index the dataframe by school name, building a dataframe to show us statistics based on home school. We used this to determine the highest and bottom performing schools based on % overall passing

The code continues to create several more dataframes based on different indexes: School type, school spending, school size, and grade level. This gave us a variety of ways to analyze the data and make observations.
